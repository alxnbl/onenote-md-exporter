**OneNote Md Exporter** is a console application running on Windows that exports your OneNote notebooks in different markdown formats. Currently, **Joplin markdown directory** and **Markdown directory** are supported.

The first objective of this tool is to offer to OneNote users the most simple and lossless solution to migrate to Joplin.
It offers an alternative to migration based on EverNote export (OneNote-> ENEX -> Joplin), in particular for people organizing their notes using hierarchy of sections and hierarchy of pages, lost during EverNote import.

# Requirements

The software requires OneNote and Word from the Microsoft Office suite. 
[OneNote for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/onenote-for-windows-10/9wzdncrfhvjl) is not supported.

Tested on : 
* Windows 7, 10
* Office 2016
* Joplin 1.6
* PanDoc 2.11
