### What has improved?

---

1. Chinese language files are added to make the whole process Chinese
2. The original author designed that all pictures of a notebook are stored in the same folder, and the folder path is: ".. /.. / \ _resource". But this is very inconvenient for me, so I implemented it. Each partition has an independent "_resource" folder to store image files.
3. Some Chinese comments have been added. Since I write in C language all the year round, the level of c# and code is limited. Some comments may be wrong. Please forgive me.

### Modify location:

---

1. Add "trad. Zh. JSON" files supporting Chinese language in the Resources folder

2. Getattachmentfilepathonpage (attachment attachment): defines a new function to migrate folders.

3. Void preparepageexport (page): this function is modified so that when creating a partition folder, a "page" is added at the same time\_ Resources folderâ€œ

4. Void exportpage (page page) in the exportservicebase.cs file comments out the original author's code so that it will not save the word document.

5. String getresourcefolderpath (node node): I changed the folder where I saved pictures to the folder where I stored files.
