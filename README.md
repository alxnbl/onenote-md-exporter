**OneNode Md Export** is a console application running on Windows that exports your OneNote notebooks in different markdown formats. Currently, **Joplin markdown directory** and **Markdown directory** are supported.

The first objective of this tool is to offer to OneNote users the most simple and lossless solution to migrate to Joplin.
It offers an alternative to migration based on EverNote export (OneNote-> ENEX -> Joplin), in particular for people organizing their notes using hierarchy of sections and hierarchy of pages, lost during EverNote import.

# Requirements

The tool requires Microsoft Office to be installed, [OneNote for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/onenote-for-windows-10/9wzdncrfhvjl) is not supported.

Tested on : 
* Windows 10
* Office 2016
* Joplin 1.6
* PanDoc 2.11

I have not yet tested the tool with Office 365. Please let me know if you did.
