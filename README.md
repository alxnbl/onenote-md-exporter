**OneNote Md Exporter** is a console application running on Windows that exports your OneNote notebooks in different markdown formats.

This tool is usefull to :
* evaluate or migrate to an alternative Knowledge Management Software like Joplin, Obsidian or other softwares based on Markdown format
* backup your OneNote Notebooks in an interoperable and open file format

The tool is easy to install and use, and generally produces better results than other OneNote export methods.
